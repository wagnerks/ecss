# Architecture Overview

`ECSS` centers on a minimal set of cooperating header‑only primitives that implement a sector (chunk) based ECS with deterministic layout, optional component grouping, and explicit maintenance (update / defrag). This document drills into the main subsystems and their interaction.

---

## 1. Core Concepts
- **EntityId**: Dense integral id (recycled). Maps in O(1) to a sector pointer through a sparse+direct table.
- **Component**: Plain struct. No inheritance or virtual cost expected. Users may group selected types.
- **Sector**: Fixed layout memory block: `[SectorHeader | CompA | CompB | ...]` for one entity across a specific grouped set.
- **SectorsArray<Ts...>**: Container that owns sectors of the grouped component set `Ts...` (possibly a single `T`). Handles allocation, iteration, erase, defrag, pin checks.
- **Registry<ThreadSafe>**: Orchestrates multiple `SectorsArray` instances, reflection (dense type ids), entity lifecycle, cross‑array views.
- **PinCounters**: Lightweight safety gate for relocation / destruction while readers observe sectors.
- **RetireAllocator / RetireBin**: Deferred reclamation of replaced pointer maps to avoid ABA / use‑after‑free in lock‑free read paths.

> Note: Costs (insert / erase / defrag) are always scoped per `SectorsArray`, never across the entire registry. A random insertion only shifts within the affected array.  

---

## 2. Memory Layout
```
[Chunk]
  ├─ sector 0: [Hdr | CompA | CompB]
  ├─ sector 1: [Hdr | CompA | CompB]
  ├─ ... up to chunk capacity (power‑of‑two growth)
```
- **Chunk Growth**: Capacity doubles (or power‑of‑two progression) to keep reallocation count low while preserving intra‑chunk address stability.
- **Header**: Stores entity id + 32‑bit (or similar) liveness mask (one bit per grouped type) enabling selective dead marking without tearing apart grouped data.
- **Offsets**: Computed at compile time in `SectorLayoutMeta.h`; inner loops avoid dynamic lookups or string hashing.
- **Grouping**: Only opt in where locality matters. Non‑grouped components get their own array (acts like a micro‑archetype only for that type).

---

## 3. Entity Lifecycle Flow
```
 takeEntity() -> (id pool / recycled) -> id reserved
 addComponent<T>(id):
   if array for T not present -> create/register
   place sector (or member) & mark alive bit
 destroyEntity(id):
   mark bits dead (deferred)
 update():
   process deferred erasures (reclaim holes)
   maybe trigger defragmentation (heuristic)
```
Dead members remain until maintenance to keep fast inner loops (simple mask test) and amortize compaction.

---

## 4. Iteration Modes
- **Full linear**: range‑for over `SectorsArray` (all sectors, including dead bits masked by component presence checks).
- **Alive component iteration**: Skip sectors where target component liveness bit is 0.
- **Ranged**: Use `Ranges` to iterate a subset of entity id intervals (reduces cache pollution with sparse workloads).
- **View<Main, Others...>**: Iterate alive sectors of the main component array; project foreign components via direct id→sector lookup (O(1) each). Grouped members of the main array require only offset arithmetic.

Cost characteristics aim for branch‑lean loops: liveness mask test + (optional) pointer projection.

---

## 5. Threading & Concurrency (when `Registry<true>`) 
| Aspect | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Reads (iteration / lookup) | Shared lock on array + pin (when necessary) |
| Structural change (insert / erase / defrag) | Unique lock + wait on relevant pin counters |
| Lookup fast path | Atomic snapshot of pointer map (id→sector*) |
| Reclamation | Retire old maps after last reader epoch |

Pins provide precise blocking: only sectors actually in motion (or destroy) cause a wait; unrelated arrays continue.

---

## 6. Pin Counters
- Each sector has a small ref count + aggregate mask for quick non‑zero checks.
- Iteration optionally pins sectors (or groups) if relocation risk exists.
- Defragmentation first performs an opportunistic check; if any pin active, it may abort early to keep frame budget stable.

---

## 7. Defragmentation Strategy
1. **Deferred Erase**: Mark dead bits; fragmentation metric increments.
2. **Heuristic**: If `(dead / total) > threshold` schedule compaction.
3. **Compaction**: Pack alive runs left; update id→ptr map only for moved sectors (O(moved)).
4. **Abort Condition**: Active pins -> opportunistic attempt aborts.

Manual overrides allow explicit `defragment()` per array or threshold adjustment per component set.

---

## 8. Reflection & Type Ids
`ReflectionHelper` assigns dense incremental `ECSType` values at registration time. Usage:
- Map component types to their owning `SectorsArray`.
- Avoid string hashing / `type_index` in hot paths.
No global registry; each `Registry` instance owns its own mapping, enabling multiple worlds without collisions.

---

## 9. Error Handling Philosophy
- Debug builds: assertions (invalid id, duplicate grouping, out‑of‑bounds, conflicting layouts).
- Release builds: assume validated usage to minimize checks (fewer branches in inner loops).

---

## 10. Differences vs Traditional Archetype ECS
| Traditional Archetypes | `ECSS` Approach |
|------------------------|-----------------|
| Entity moves between full archetype tables when composition changes | Only grouped sets share storage; adding unrelated component just touches its own array |
| Potential explosion of archetype combinations | Explicit opt‑in grouping keeps combination count controlled |
| Central structural churn on component add/remove | Localized mutation (only affected arrays) |
| Complex query planner | Straightforward view: main + projected foreign arrays |

Result: predictable performance and simpler mental model for targeted locality.

---

## 11. Hot Path Anatomy (View Iteration)
Pseudocode (conceptual):
```cpp
for (Sector* s : mainArray) {
    if (!s->aliveMaskBit(MainIdx)) continue;
    auto* mainComp = s->componentPtr<Main>();
    auto* other    = lookupForeign<Other>(s->id); // O(1) direct map
    // ... user function ...
}
```
No variant visitation, no dynamic dispatch; only mask test + pointer arithmetic + optional projection.

---

## 12. Memory Safety & Relocation
- Trivial components may be relocated with raw `memmove` during compaction or local shifts.
- Non‑trivial types invoke move / destroy helpers generated via template instantiation (stored in small function table within layout meta).
- Pins ensure no reader references stale addresses.

> Recommendation: Keep components trivially movable/destructible whenever possible. If **all** grouped members in a `SectorsArray` are trivial, random (non‑tail) insertions and defragment moves degrade mostly to `memmove` of contiguous bytes, greatly improving worst‑case insertion cost. This advantage is per `SectorsArray` — having trivial components in one array does not affect others.

---

## 13. Configuration Points
- `ThreadSafe` template parameter on `Registry`.
- Per grouped set defrag threshold setter.
- Optional explicit grouping via `registerArray<A,B,...>()`.
- Manual `update()` cadence (e.g. once per frame) to amortize maintenance.

---

## 14. Performance Intent (Qualitative)
- O(1) id→sector lookup.
- Append / tail insert amortized O(1).
- Random middle insert cost limited to shifting within the single affected `SectorsArray` (faster when trivial: raw `memmove`).
- Defrag proportional to moved sectors, early abort to keep worst‑case jitter low.

---

## 15. Extensibility Notes
- Additional component metadata (e.g., custom allocators, debug instrumentation) can wrap arrays without altering iteration semantics.
- Future systems (e.g., scheduling) can pin sector ranges for deterministic SOA transformations.

---

## 16. Summary
`ECSS` trades universal automatic archetype re‑composition for explicit, controllable grouping and deterministic low‑overhead memory management. The architecture emphasizes:
- Small surface area
- Predictable cache behavior
- Optional concurrency
- Cheap structural mutation isolated to the minimum necessary storage
- Improved random insertion & relocation speed when arrays use only trivial components
